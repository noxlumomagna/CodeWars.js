You are given a list of unique integers arr, and two integers a and b. Your task is to find out whether or not a and b appear consecutively in arr, and return a boolean value (True if a and b are consecutive, False otherwise).

It is guaranteed that a and b are both present in arr.

function consecutive(arr,a,b){
  let indexA = arr.indexOf(a)
  let indexB = arr.indexOf(b)
  if(indexA == (indexB+1) || indexA == (indexB-1)){
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
