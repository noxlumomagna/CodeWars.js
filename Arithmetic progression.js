In your class, you have started lessons about arithmetic progression. Since you are also a programmer, you have decided to write a function that will return the first n elements of the sequence with the given common difference d and first element a. Note that the difference may be zero!

The result should be a string of numbers, separated by comma and space.

function arithmeticSequenceElements(a,d,n){
	return Array(n).fill(a).map((e,i)=>e+(d*i)).join(', ')
}
