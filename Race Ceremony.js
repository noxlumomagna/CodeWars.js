Given the numbers of blocks available, return an array / tuple or another data structure depending on the language (refer sample tests) with the heights of 2nd, 1st, 3rd places platforms.

function racePodium(blocks) {
  if(blocks == 7) return[2,4,1]
  let second = Math.ceil(blocks/3)
  return[second, second + 1 ,blocks - second * 2 - 1]
}
